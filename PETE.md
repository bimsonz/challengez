# Commit Walkthrough

This repo contains three distinct phases of work on the alias generator challenge, each demonstrating a different working mode.

## Commit 1: `feat: implement alias generator CLI tool`

**Mode: AI implementation with human direction**

I gave Claude the challenge brief and made the key architectural decisions upfront: light service layer with an interface (not full DI, not bare static methods), xUnit tests with thorough coverage, CLI args as the README suggests, and throw on invalid account names rather than silently producing bad data. Claude then implemented end-to-end from those decisions — the spec interpretation, algorithm, test cases, and code were its one-shot pass. It works, passes 21 tests, handles the planted duplicate trap in the data — but within the guardrails I set.

## Commit 2: `refactor: three-phase pipeline with pre-computation and parallel support`

**Mode: AI-directed algorithmic review**

I asked Claude to review its own work through the lens of an algorithm expert — concurrency, resource efficiency, processing order. It found a genuine bug (redundant `.ToList()` copying the entire result set), identified ~630 redundant string operations from repeated per-mapping work, and restructured into a three-phase pipeline with adaptive parallelism. The parallel path uses `Parallel.For` above a threshold where it actually helps, and sequential below where thread-pool overhead dominates. This is what you get when AI reviews its own output with specific direction.

## Commit 3: `refactor: manual review — extract responsibilities and tighten CLI`

**Mode: Human review with AI execution**

My manual pass through the code. This is where experience and taste come in — things AI doesn't naturally prioritise:

- Removed the hardcoded `data.json` fallback — no magic defaults in a CLI tool
- Replaced `Console.Error.WriteLine` + exit codes with proper exceptions (`ArgumentException`, `FileNotFoundException`)
- Enforced consistent brace style throughout
- Used C# list pattern (`args is not [var path, ..]`) instead of length checks
- Replaced null-coalescing throw with explicit null check
- Extracted `DataValidator`, `FragmentPreComputer`, and `AliasResolver` into their own files — the service was doing too much
- Switched output loop from per-line `Console.WriteLine` with string interpolation to buffered `StreamWriter` with direct writes

The difference between commits 2 and 3 is the difference between "technically optimal" and "code I'd want to maintain." AI gets the algorithm right but doesn't have opinions about code organisation, brace style, or what feels wrong when you read it. That's the human layer.
